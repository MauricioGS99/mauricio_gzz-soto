I am a Professor at [Tecnologico de Monterrey](https://tec.mx/) in Monterrey, Mexico.
I hold a PhD in Computer Science from [INAOE](https://www.inaoep.mx/) (advised by
[L. Enrique Sucar](https://ccc.inaoep.mx/~esucar/)), a Master's in Data Science,
and a Bachelor's in Mathematics.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on **causal inference**, **decision theory**, and **Bayesian statistics**.
I am particularly interested in the intersection of causality and decision-making under
uncertainty, as well as the philosophical foundations of probability and statistics.

My recent work includes contributions to decision-making under causal uncertainty,
published in *Erkenntnis*.

## Teaching

I teach courses on probability, statistics, Bayesian statistics, machine learning,
and artificial intelligence at the undergraduate and graduate levels. I currently
coordinate an AI concentration program and teach courses including:

- TC3006C: Probability and Statistics for AI
- TC3002B: AI concentration courses
